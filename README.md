# 🎨 AIDE-Colors (2017)

Customizable theme overlay for AIDE, designed for CyanogenMod/LineageOS users.  
Originally created in 2017 using AIDE on-device. This project allows developers to recolor the entire interface of the AIDE editor using a structured XML file.

## 💡 About

This theme was not meant to be a final product — it was a tool for other users to experiment with colors, customize syntax highlighting and UI, and learn how theme overlays work in CM/Lineage.

## ✍️ How it works

- The core of the theme is a `colors.xml` file with all editable colors used in the AIDE interface.
- Each color is documented with comments in Russian to explain its usage.
- The `.apk` file is a standard CyanogenMod-style theme package and is not a launchable app.
