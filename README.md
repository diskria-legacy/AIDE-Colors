# ðŸŽ¨ AIDE-Colors (2017)

A customizable theme overlay for the AIDE Android IDE, designed for use with CyanogenMod / LineageOS theme engine.  
This package modifies the entire AIDE interface: background, syntax colors, line numbers, UI elements â€” everything.

## âœ¨ Features

- System-wide recoloring of AIDE via `colors.xml` overlay  
- Editable theme file with inline comments for all color fields  
- Dark syntax highlighting with custom styling for keywords, strings, operators, etc.  
- Designed for experimentation: tweak and build your own AIDE color scheme  

## ðŸ“¦ About this project

This theme was originally built using [AIDE](https://www.android-ide.com/) in 2017 â€” directly on-device.  
It was created as a tool for customization and experimentation, not a final product.  
The original repository is lost, but the `.apk` and XML config have been preserved and archived here.
